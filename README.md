This capstone course challenges students to apply programming concepts to develop functional and practical programs that address complex problems similar to those that organizations face in the workplace today. Students will design and implement a software solution from an algorithm, following a project plan and requirements specification that incorporates correct data types, data structures, and debugging and testing strategies. Students will use their choice of development platforms (e.g., Java or C++) and integrate external data from a local or server-based data storage system.
